# Contributing

This document describes how to get Praelatus up and running for development so
you can get hacking on Praelatus.

## Dependencies

## Quick Start

praelatus-client currently doesn't have a build process. 

To run the project in development mode, run `npm start`.

To run the tests, run `npm run test`. To run them in watch mode, run `npm run test:watch`.

You're ready to read the contribution guidelines [below](#guidelines)!

## Contribution Guidelines
<div id="guidelines"></div>

I'm going to reiterate this first since it's important. We have a [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/praelatus/frontend/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md). 

Follow it.

1. May your commit messages be short and when they are not use the space below.
   A model commit message looks like this:

```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent

```

2. We follow
   [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) so
   please branch responsibly. All pull requests should be made against
   [Develop](https://github.com/praelatus/frontend/tree/develop)

3. If you have a question, *ask*! We don't mind answering any questions you may
   have.

That's it! If you have any further questions or want some more real time
interaction we have a slack and if you'd like an invite you can send an email
to praelatusfoss@gmail.com until we get the heroku thing set up!
