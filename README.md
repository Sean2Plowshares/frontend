## Why

Because bugzilla is ugly and we want to make a platform that integrates with 
all of the existing solutions like github issues and gitlab, ideally I'd also 
like to have features such that we could replace proprietary systems like JIRA 
and Rally in the enterprise while bringing issue / bug tracking into the
21st century with things like Social Networking logins and centralizing this
very important piece of running an Open Source project.

## Contributing

The basics:

1. Fork it! :fork_and_knife:
2. Create an issue describing what you're working on.
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
6. :fire: Submit a pull request :D :fire:

All pull requests should go to the develop branch not master. Thanks!
